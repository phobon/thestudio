# the studio, physiotherapy and clinical pilates
Small business site for a physiotherapy practice located in Perth, Western Australia [http://phobon.io/thestudio]

## what was used to make it
I used **jquery**, **velocity** and built it all in typescript

## how to use this
the site is set up as an express project, so you should be able to just:

1. clone
2. express thestudio
3. npm install
4. typings install (to get all our typescript defs)
5. run gulp tasks: 'release'

check it out - or just rip out any code/css and just use them
